        <b>TODAY WAS MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Hence why I'm a little bit late on this blog post. But I kinda just wanted to wait until today so I could talk about it haha. So today I had lots of fun. The previous night I spent with my roommates and one of them baked a DELICIOUS chocolate cake for me. We all hung out, played video games and just had a good time in general. Today I used to be able to see friends and family. First I went to see my grandma and my cousin and it was really nice. My grandma made me $30 richer and I love my cousin like a sister so it was awesome to be able to hang out with her. Then I drove over to see my oldest cousin and his wife. We played video games together and just had a good talk. That's honestly all I really did, but I really enjoyed it. I just can't believe I'm 22 now... Life only gets harder from here *lightly sighs*

        In terms of the week leading up to my birthday, I didn't get too much done, but I still accomplished some things. I used the wellness day to my advantage in order to take a short breath and let loose. I did however finish my rotoscoping exercise in my moving image class which you can view <a href="https://vimeo.com/517879536">here.</a>

        I will say on a personal level that I'm not 100% satisfied with how my homepage turned out for the project, but I still love it and know that I can improve upon it. I just wish I had spent a little bit more time on it rather than my animation and photos.
