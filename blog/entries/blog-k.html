        This week was really needed in terms of the wellness week. I was able to get a good amount of schoolwork done on top of self-care. As you may remember from my previous blogs, I like to skate A LOT in my spare time because it's the one thing that allows me to have fun and focus my thoughts. I ended up going on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and as I'm typing this now my body <b>HURTS.</b> It was worth it though as it allowed me to de-stress.

        In terms of schoolwork I've been doing pretty well in keeping as caught up as I can be. I've been <b>HEAVILY</b> grinding on my animation making sure that it turns out the best before it's due on the 22nd. Here's a little snippet of one of my dances. The song is "Break Up With Your Girlfriend" by Ariana Grande and each song in my animation is vital to telling my story of how I've learned how to love. Well, if you listen to the words in this song I think most people can understand the message that is being sent. At this point in my love story, I've given up on love and all I want to do is mess around with others. It was a dark point in my life and the dance that comes with it displays it perfectly. If you are interested in seeing the other dances, I have a majority of them uploaded on my <a href="https://vimeo.com/user132243957">Vimeo</a>.
