        This week was probably the most chill week in all honesty. But this upcoming week has me extremely stressed out. I have a website due on the 20th and then I have an animation due on the 22nd. Not only that, but I start a new job with Amazon on the 16th which is very exciting. However, because I train on both Friday and Saturday, that leaves me with less time to work on these big final projects. I know I'm going to find a way to push through, it just all seems like a lot at this current moment.

        Remember that animation that I showed on my last blog post? Well if you click <a href="https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/535631747">here</a> you can see the entire section of animation because I went through some serious grinding last night to get it done early so I can work on my last section before it is due.

        Some last notes for this class. First of all, THIS CLASS IS AMAZING. Never would I have expected to be able to code a website from scratch and create the things that I have. This will be EXTREMELY useful to me in the future because I can make it look however I want past the extent of what 'website creation' subscriptions offer. I was a little bit slwo to start, but I wanted to prove that I'm here to learn and grow so once I put a little bit more time into it than I was, things started to improve at a fast pace. And now here I am creating a website for a community that I love being a part of! Thank you guys so much for teaching me all of this new cool stuff that I will DEFINITELY carry with me into my future :)

        Last but definitely not least, I have a story to tell. Growing up gay has always been hard, especially being the age and time period I was born in. Throughout middle and high school, I never really understood my feelings and didn't get why I felt how I felt. But the problem was: <b>I couldn't talk to anyone about it.</b> Not so much middle school, but high school? Man. Those were the toughest years of my life. I was the quiet kid who sat on the steps and listened to music while everyone else seemed to walk around in slow motion. No one knew my sexuality, and if they did, I would be the school laughing stock. Being gay during the time I was in high school isn't as socially accepted as it is today. There were always gay jokes and people were already indirectly bullying me by making these constant jokes. Anyways. The moral of the story is that I didnt fully realize who I was and I didnt come out until I graduated high school. Now we get to the fun part: <b>my parents.</b> When I told my mom of course she was thrown back, but she always knew. Moms usually do. My dad... He wasn't too happy about it. But I know he still loves me regardless even though he isn't the type of person to say it out loud. He's very hard-headed and it takes him a long time to accept some things, and this was one of those things. I mean... I get it. His only child, his son, jsut told him that he was gay. And again this was still during a time when it's starting to get more accepted but not fully. But anyways. When I told him, he looked pissed and I've always carried the thought in my head that he won't ever fully understand me and that I'm not sure if he wants to. But this thought changed a few days ago. I went to visit my paretns and my mom hands me a box. I open it and there is a pair of rainbow (pride edition) converse shoes and she tells me that my dad got them for me.

        I don't know if he got them for me because he knows I like colorful things for if it's deeper than that, but it hit me deep on a emotional level. Him getting me these shoes is like him saying <b>"I see you and I love you."</b> I cried after I went home with the shoes. No matter how worn these shoes get, I'm going to keep them. My dad sees me. Even though he may never fully understand me or fully accept my sexuality, he sees me. And the fact that I'm seen and loved by my father was the greatest feeling I've felt not only this week, but this year.
