<p> Aside from the confusing grid above me, I wanna tell you about how I'm doing. This week has actually still been really difficult for me in terms of catching up. As for the grid above me, it was me experimenting with the grid for css, but I would've liked to do more to it. However, it is still really cool and an effective way to creating separate blocks. Within time, I will update this grid and work further on it. In terms of the talk that we did last class, I found it extremely interesting. It's honestly scary that technology has access to all of our information, but at this point there really is no stopping the advance. We will continue upgrading our technology until it becomes a problem and we become "too advanced". </p>
