    <div>BLOG I</div>
    <h1 class="text1">Hello</h1>
    <p class="text2">
        This is actually something that I was experimenting with JUST as I am writing this blog so this is exciting. I found this really cool light background on codepen and then started playing with how to place text in random places on the page, which I've seemed to accomplish haha. Hopefully I can take this newly found skill and FINALLY apply it to my homepage.

        I don't really know what to say in this blog. My brain feels clouded with all of the stress and the pressure to complete all of my projects on time. I'm very proud with the progress I'm making and I think both my animation and my website are going to turn out to be amazing in the end. It's really hard to balance my time because my animation swipes all of my focus because I want to get those frames drawn!!! But then I have to remember that I have to keep on top of my website too. But then <b>WAIT!</b> There's a photgraphy project and a paper due <b>JUST AROUND THE CORNER.</b> At least my roommates are there for me when I need them and I have the ability to skate sometimes in order to de-stress.

        Wowowowowowow!!! This is <b><u>AMAZING!</u></b> I'm absolutely ecstatic that I just figured out how to place text like this. I've been scratching my head and trying to learn through trial and error and I hadn't figured it out til now. Yay! Well. You know how <b>MY</b> Sunday went :) I hope whoever is reading this learned something new today like me. It feels great.
