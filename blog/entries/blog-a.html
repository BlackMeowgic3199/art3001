        This week honestly hasn't exactly been the best. The first thing is that as soon as classes started, I turned out to be positive with Covid. I haven't been feeling well and I've been trying my best to keep up with classes while feeling like poop. My stress levels are above and beyond because not only do I have to play catch-up with classes due to being sick, but I was three credit hours short and JUST got into a fourth class so I could get those credit hours be considered a full-time student. Life is pretty stressful this week, but I have a feeling that my luck will turn around and that I have a really good semester. I'm honestly really excited to begin making my own website and learn how to alter it. I'm also extremely excited to create another animation this year. The stress is overwhelming right now, but I won't let it stop me from having a good semester :)
