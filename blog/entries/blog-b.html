        This week has gotten a little bit easier. To be completely honest, I'm STILL playing catch-up with all my classes, but I'm all caught up for the most part. Some things I learned this week:
    </p>

    <li>How to style further with coding</li>
    <li>How to animate gifs in a still image on After Effects</li>
    <li>How to communicate with other students/colleagues in terms of learning each other's assets and putting them together in order to problem solve</li>
    <li>How to use the shutter mode on a camera</li>

    <p>
        In other news, earlier this week I went skating two days in a row and was extremely exhausted. However, I had an amazing time. During one of the two times I went with my cousin. I also ordered some new wireless earbuds the other day and they already arrived TODAY. They are <b>AMAZING</b> and they have great sound quality and I am <i>extremely excited</i> to try them out when I skate.
