        <b>You found letter number four in the sequence of 7 hidden letters. Therefore, you get one fact about me.</b>

    <i>Fact 4: This fact actually relates to the last one if you've found it already. I have a very strong meaning to the artwork that I make. My theme typically circles around teaching others about themselves or helping them see the world around them more clearly. In broader terms, I help people see the truth through art. I honestly feel as I've progressed through the years it has become more about expressing myself, but while doing this I also encourage others to express themselves without fear of judgement. I just want to convey the message that love is ALWAYS the answer and if you learn to love yourself anything is possible</i>
