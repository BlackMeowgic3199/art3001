        I am part of the LGBTQ community. I came out as gay around the time I was starting as a freshman in college so it was very hard coming out as gay AND being released into an entirely new world of faces. To this day it still isn't easy. I still face judgement. I still face fear. I still face people who don't believe in it. But that will NEVER stop me from loving myself and the community I am involved with. #LoveAlwaysWins
