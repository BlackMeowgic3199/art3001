        Yellow is the color that catches the most attention. It is the most luminous of all the colors and even though it represents happiness and creativity, it also is used to represent danger and caution.

        To further the meaning of yellow in terms of darks and lights, the dark side of yellow holds true to its name. Darker yellows typically mean "cowardice, betrayal and madness". On top of this, it is also a color of "caution and physical illness." Perhaps this is why where yellow pigments come from are typically toxic metals (as well as urine).
