        <b>You found letter number three in the sequence of 7 hidden letters. Therefore, you get one fact about me.</b> 
    </p>

<p>
    <i>Fact 3: My ultimate source of happiness used to be my cat Jinx. I'll eventually update this and upload a photo of him. But he used to follow me everwhere and I used to call him my shadow. I truly miss him, but I continue to live with happiness for him because I know its what he would've wanted. His answer was to love anyone who came into his space, so I continue that message today in my life and in my art. R.I.P. Jinx</i>
