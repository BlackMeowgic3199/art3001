        In all honesty, green is one of my least favorite colors. But it still holds an interesting history and meaning. Green results from mixing together <a href="blue.html">blue</a> and <a href="yellow.html">yellow.</a> It started out as just a color, as most colors did, but as time progressed it is also the "symbol of ecology and a verb."

        As we all know, St. Patrick's day circles around the color green. This is because in Ireland, green symbolizes luck. However, in other places it holds a different meaning. "In Muslim countries, it is a holy color" and during the Ming Dynasty it was the "color of the heavens." However, since the very beginning, green has symbolized "growth, rebirth and fertility."
