        "Blue is the favorite color of the people. It is cold, wet and slow as compared to red's warmth and intensity."
    </p>

    <p>
        What's really interesting is that it has more meaning than any other color. Branching from this, different shades of blue can hold different meanings:
    </p>

    <p>
        ~ Dark blue --> "trust and intelligence"
    </p>

    <p>
        ~ Bright blue --> "cleanliness, strength, responsibility"
    </p>

    <p>
        ~ Light blue --> "peace, spiritual, infinity" 
    </p>

    <p>
        Again, you can mix blue with <a hreflang="red.html">red</a> to make a completely new color and this color is <a href="violet.html">violet</a>. One of my favo<a href="r.html">r</a>ite colors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Or, you can mix blue with <a href="yellow.html">yellow</a> to make <a href="green.html">green</a>. We could go even deeper and mix blue with <a href="green.html">green</a> to make blue-green, but we should stay on track!
