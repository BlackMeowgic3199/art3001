        <b>You found letter number five in the sequence of 7 hidden letters. Therefore, you get one fact about me.</b>

    <i>Fact 5: We're already deep into the exposure so I guess I can tell you something I'm bad at. I'm very very very bad at socializing. A personal fact about me is that I have social anxiety so it makes it very difficult for me to meet and talk to new people. Sometimes it doesn't even have to be someone I've never met before. My friends could invite me out and my social anxiety can kick in and make me think that something bad will happen. So, in turn, it pulls me away from social events and hanging with friends. I'm slowly working on it and I'm getting better, but it'll take time.</i>
