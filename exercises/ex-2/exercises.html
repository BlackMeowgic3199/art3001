    <p style="background-color:Tomato;">Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
        Some say in ice. <br>
        From what I’ve tasted of desire <br>
        I hold with those who favour fire. <br>
        But if it had to perish twice, <br>
        I think I know enough of hate <br>
        To say that for destruction ice <br>
        Is also great <br>
        And would suffice.</p>
